Configure Jenkins

Now, set up a Jenkins pipeline job to poll the Git repository and run the pipeline defined in the Jenkinsfile.

Log in to Jenkins:
Open Jenkins in your browser (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
Log in with your credentials.
Create a New Pipeline Job:
Click New Item in the Jenkins dashboard.
Enter a name (e.g., Selenium-Grid-Tests).
Select Pipeline as the project type, then click OK.
Configure the Pipeline:
In the job configuration page:
General:
Optionally, add a description like “Run Selenium tests on code push”.
Build Triggers:
Check Poll SCM.
Enter a schedule in the format * * * * * (this polls every minute). For less frequent polling, use:
H/5 * * * * (every 5 minutes).
H * * * * (every hour).
Leave the webhook option unchecked, as you specified not to use webhooks.
Pipeline:
Set Definition to Pipeline script from SCM.
Set SCM to Git.
In Repository URL, enter your Git repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git).
If your repository is private, click Add under Credentials to add your Git username/password or SSH key.
Set Branch Specifier to */main (or your branch name, e.g., */master).
Set Script Path to Jenkinsfile (the path to your Jenkinsfile in the repository).
Click Save.
